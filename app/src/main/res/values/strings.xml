            Sometimes We Wish\n\n
            To Be Care Free\n\n
            Like An Innocent Child\n\n
            Without A Single Worry\n\n
            The Tension In Life\n\n
            To Dissolve Away\n\n
            The Race To Gain Wealth\n\n
            We Have To Follow Every Day\n\n
            Seems To Be Just Meaningless\n\n
            Sometimes We Want Ourselves\n\n
            To Be Emotionless And Feeling Free\n\n
            So What Is Said Or Done To Us\n\n
            Remain Immune To All Around Us.\n\n\n</string>


        <string name="world">

    You were made for the world\n\n
    You were born,\n\n
    to change the world\n\n
    You were given eyes,\n\n
    to see the world\n\n
    You were blessed by legs,\n\n
    to explore the world\n\n
    Donate yourself to the world\n\n
    world will be yours\n\n
    Success will be yours\n\n
    History will be yours\n\n\n

    How lucky we were to start our day,\n\n
    With laughs, love, and a lot of grace,\n\n
    She is modest, wise, honest, And brave,\n\n
    She will cheer you up when you just need a break\n\n\n

    Even when you have a bad day,\n\n
    She will pick you up and slap your face,\n\n
    Remind you of all the good things ahead,\n\n
    That your life is perfect in every aspect\n\n\n

    Her happiness is contagious,\n\n
    Her charisma is blinding,\n\n
    She is the best at advising\n\n\n

    No matter how much I struggled within,\n\n
    She taught me to keep on going,\n\n
    That life will always be this way,\n\n
    So you should just smile everyday\n\n\n

    With her we learnt,\n\n
    Like books, memories can not be burnt,\n\n
    You will not find a scaffold for them,\n\n
    So, it is better to learn to deal with them\n\n\n

    I will let you in on a secret to know,\n\n
    If you stay with her you will not be bored,\n\n
    Mess with her and you will not be cured,\n\n
    Together we have had so much fun,\n\n
    If you insult someone, get ready to run\n\n\n

    Now when we grow old (but not ill of course),\n\n
    We can still look back and feel you close,\n\n
    And remember all those inside jokes,\n\n
    with Chips, heroes, and the modern prose\n\n\n

    I have learnt to be humble,\n\n
    For in a universe so humongous,\n\n
    That could fit billions of stars,\n\n
    We are part of nothing but a single dot,\n\n\n

    She is got a lot to give,\n\n
    She is the teacher who inspired me to live\n\n\n

        <string name="deeds">
            These people we try to please,\n\n
    These grades we try to achieve,\n\n
    With those dreams we sleep.\n\n
    Trying so hard to believe,\n\n
    in the heroes we want to be.\n\n\n

    These things will never satisfy you,\n\n
    No matter how hard you try,\n\n
    It will all leave.\n\n
    Nothing good lasts forever.\n\n
    Is not that what you believe?\n\n\n

    What makes you happy,\n\n
    Could it be the clapping?\n\n
    Could it be the cheers?\n\n
    Could it be the whooting?\n\n
    Or the compliments you hear?\n\n\n

    Will all those in the grave,\n\n
    save you from your fate?\n\n
    This desire to be successful,\n\n
    that you hold on to for so long,\n\n
    will it be there when this world is gone?\n\n\n

    Patience.\n\n
    Nothing matters my dear,\n\n
    So do not waste your precious tears,\n\n
    for the ending that you fear.\n\n\n

    Nothing matters but your deeds,\n\n
    That is what you should believe.\n\n\n

        <string name="peace">

    Give peace a chance\n\n
    Give sanity a glance\n\n
    Many will try to plea\n\n
    No one will stare in glee\n\n\n

    Give peace a chance\n\n
    Give sanity a glance\n\n
    Many will fight their fears\n\n
    No one will refuse the tears\n\n\n

    Peace should be rejoiced\n\n
    Hate should be denounced\n\n
    Peace should be enjoyed\n\n
    Sanity should be announced\n\n\n

    Give peace a chance\n\n
    Give sanity a glance\n\n
    Walls are meant for safety\n\n
    Choices can not be so hasty\n\n\n

    Give peace a chance\n\n
    Give sanity a glance\n\n
    Wise words enact as gold\n\n
    Spirituality is the only mode\n\n\n

    Oh ,Dear woman\n\n
    You are precious\n\n
    More than the water,\n\n\n

    Your are younger\n\n
    More than the years\n\n\n

    You are beautiful\n\n
    More than the models,\n\n\n

    Your are brighter\n\n
    More than the Stars\n\n\n

    You are stronger\n\n
    More than the iron\n\n\n

    It is not your colour,\n\n
    Your skin, your complection\n\n
    Which makes you beautiful\n\n
    But your compassion and\n\n
    Gratitude with which you\n\n
    Deal with the world .\n\n\n

    It is not the dressing\n\n
    Not the jewels\n\n
    Not the diamonds\n\n
    Which makes you\n\n\n
    Powerful\n\n
    But your perseverance\n\n
    With which you tackle\n\n
    The situations of life ,\n\n\n

    Your are more than jewels\n\n
    You are more than complections\n\n
    Your are much beautiful\n\n
    With all imperfections\n\n
    You do not need to be perfect\n\n
    You are Okay,\n\n
    The way you are.\n\n\n

    And the people who finds\n\n
    You in skin, in dresses\n\n
    In jewels , In perfection\n\n
    Are not the true lovers\n\n
    But the disturbance of\n\n
    Your life ,\n\n
    Who are continually\n\n
    Creating mess in\n\n
    Your life.\n\n\n

    Your smile is more than\n\n
    The brightness of moon\n\n
    You are more colourful\n\n
    Than the flowers of Garden\n\n\n

    This World is nothing\n\n
    Without you\n\n
    You are more than\n\n
    The life.\n\n
    You are more than Diva\n\n\n

    "The beauty of life,\n\n
    lies in the ponds and streams,\n\n
    that you walk by while you day dream.\n\n
    It is in the chirping of every bird,\n\n
    in the clouds that form above,\n\n
    in the rain that cleanses the heart,\n\n
    and the people who make you laugh\n\n\n

    It is in the rain, the thunder, and the lightning bolt\n\n
    in the warmth of the Sun, and the winter cold\n\n
    in the darkness of the night, the howling of the wind\n\n
    in the dancing daffodils and the river is steady flow\n\n
    and the people who smile at you\n\n
    when you learn to let go\n\n\n

    It is in the trees that stand so tall,\n\n
    in the childish spirit that lightens the heart,\n\n
    in the songs our mothers sing,\n\n
    and the nostalgia memories bring\n\n\n

    It is in the gentle breeze and the starry sky,\n\n
    in the loud extroverts and the introverts who are shy,\n\n
    in the tears our fathers hide,\n\n
    And the struggle before every goodbye\n\n\n"
